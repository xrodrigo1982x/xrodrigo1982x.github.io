### The author  
#### Rodrigo Silva

Born in Rio de Janeiro. Living in Lisbon.

I'm a software developer that enjoy so much my profession that I'd love to help people to learn how to code and create their own stuff.  

I started developing desktop applications, but watching the world change with smartphones made me go towards cloud applications and mobile development.  

No doubt choosing software development as a profession opened me so many opportunities that I believe it should happen to others.
