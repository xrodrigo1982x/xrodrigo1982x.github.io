<h2>The author</h2>  
<h3>Rodrigo Silva</h3>

<p>Born in Rio de Janeiro. Living in Lisbon.</p>

<p>I'm a software developer that enjoy so much my profession that I'd love to help people to learn how to code and create their own stuff.</p>  

<p>I started developing desktop applications, but watching the world change with smartphones made me go towards cloud applications and mobile development.</p>  

<p>No doubt choosing software development as a profession opened me so many opportunities that I believe it should happen to others.</p>
